Once this difference exists, people will inevitably find ways to release it to obtain energy for useful work. Arbitrageurs emerge accordingly, smoothing market price differences while profiting, thus becoming beneficiaries of this 'systematic bribery'.</p><p>This article mainly discusses the positive significance of arbitrage types that can be accepted and recognized by decentralized markets. As for those irregular arbitrage behaviors that excessively harm user interests, this article will briefly mention them. After all, mechanisms are constantly developing and improving, and the relationship between compliance and non-compliance is not binary but involves complex 'gray areas'.</p><h2>Why Arbitrage Significance is Amplified in Decentralization</h2><p>In traditional finance, there are many means to maintain market stability and effectiveness, with arbitrage being merely the last link. Central banks, as the 'heart' of traditional financial systems, directly intervene during market panic and liquidity crises through interest rate adjustments, money printing, or window guidance. Regulatory agencies and laws use circuit breakers, trading halts, and insider trading enforcement. Designated market makers fulfill contractual obligations with massive capital pools and special privileges. Only then do arbitrageurs appear as porters, smoothing minor price differences between Chicago and New York.</p><p>But in the decentralized world, everything has changed dramatically. In Web3's 'dark forest', capital runs wild: no 'parent' to rescue markets, no legal constraints, no privileges or obligations... If a token's price goes to zero or a prediction market's logic collapses, the blockchain itself doesn't care. Only one thing is eternally reliable—cold code.</p><p>Blockchain completely breaks traditional finance's trust mechanism, rejecting 'authority' and embracing 'game theory'. Therefore, arbitrage, as the most direct mechanism responding to non-Nash equilibrium in price sub-games, naturally gains amplified significance.</p><h2>How Benign Arbitrage Maintains Order in Decentralized World</h2><p>When mentioning arbitrage, people's first impression is often stereotypical, thinking of 'sandwich' attacks, high slippage, and involution. But conversely, what would happen to decentralized markets without arbitrageurs? Uniswap prices would never follow Binance updates, and Polymarket's various future predictions would experience 'logic collapse'. So arbitrage has both good and evil aspects. Benign arbitrage is a weapon for maintaining order in the decentralized world, relying not on information asymmetry to exploit users, but on public information and mathematical logic to profit by eliminating inefficiencies.</p><h3>Price Anchoring Mechanism</h3><p>In price anchoring mechanisms, arbitrage behavior provides physical correction for the DeFi field. Automated market makers are limited; they don't perceive external price information, with pricing entirely determined by pool assets and preset functions. While arbitrage doesn't directly provide price data, it reflects external market information to automated market makers by bearing risk and paying gas fees, which is then manifested in price changes.</p><p>Benign arbitrageurs can be understood as decentralized oracles, so the slippage or loss users pay within reasonable ranges is essentially a service fee for purchasing 'accurate prices'. Moreover, due to blockchain transaction 'atomicity' (an on-chain transaction is either fully executed in a block or entirely rolled back upon any step failure, with no 'partial execution' or 'post-facto correction'), arbitrage behavior fundamentally escapes traditional finance's risk exposure problem.</p><p>Additionally, flash loans greatly compress arbitrage's capital threshold and error correction costs, making market price deviation correction no longer dependent on long-term capital occupation or the monopoly of large institutions. Overall, arbitrage behavior in decentralized price anchoring mechanisms presents an almost idealized form: low risk, high certainty, high capital efficiency.</p><h3>Prediction Market Probability Games</h3><p>Benign arbitrage not only plays an important role in price anchoring mechanisms but also undertakes mathematical and logical correction work in prediction market probability games. If the arbitrage discussed earlier mainly corrects 'price errors', prediction markets further reveal a deeper problem: markets not only report wrong prices but also violate the most basic mathematical and logical axioms.</p><p>A significant feature of prediction markets is that they allow participants to bet separately on different outcomes of complex events. This design greatly enhances expressive power but also provides survival space for elementary mathematical errors.</p><h4>Probability Normalization of Mutually Exclusive Outcomes</h4><p>A most basic example is the probability normalization problem of mutually exclusive outcomes: Taking presidential elections as an example, in a market with mutually exclusive results, the sum of probabilities for all candidates 'winning' must theoretically equal 100%. However, in actual trading, one can often observe this state: the sum of YES contract prices for candidates A, B, and C is significantly less than 1. In other words, the market overall 'underestimates the certain occurrence of some result'.</p><p>This state doesn't stem from profound information asymmetry but simply because different traders participate in different sub-markets without anyone caring about global consistency. Arbitrageurs' correction method is very direct: they don't need to predict who will win, only need to identify the mathematical fact that 'probability sum is less than 1', then simultaneously buy all undervalued options. As long as one result must eventually occur, this combination constitutes risk-free profit. Through this method, arbitrageurs forcibly push the probability sum back to 1.</p><h4>Causal Logic Inversion</h4><p>More subtle and destructive than mathematical errors is causal logic inversion in prediction markets. Cross-conditional arbitrage is a direct response to such problems: Taking 'Trump wins Republican nomination' and 'Trump wins presidential election' as examples, the latter logically depends on the former as a prerequisite. If a candidate doesn't even win party nomination, his probability of winning the general election should be zero. Therefore, 'winning election' probability cannot exceed 'winning nomination' probability.</p><p>However, in actual markets, due to different participant groups and asynchronous information updates, this absurd state often appears: Trump's contract price for winning the election is higher than his contract price for winning party nomination. This price relationship isn't a matter of opinion but a direct violation of causal structure.</p><p>Arbitrageurs' operational logic here is equally simple: buy undervalued 'nomination' contracts while selling overvalued 'election' contracts, constructing a logically consistent combined position. As arbitrage funds enter, price inversion is gradually smoothed, and the market re-obeys basic causal constraints.</p><h4>Cross-Market Information Transmission</h4><p>Prediction market logical correction isn't limited to its interior. When prediction markets coexist with other financial markets, arbitrageurs often become key mediators of cross-market information transmission. For example, prediction markets (like Polymarket) trade event outcomes, while perpetual contracts or spot exchanges (like Hyperliquid) trade token prices.</p><p>In pre-market stages, these two markets often operate separately: one side bets on 'whether a token's opening price exceeds $4', while the other has already formed pre-market trading prices around $3.8. If the prediction market still gives high probability to 'opening price above $4', obvious inconsistency exists between the two markets.</p><p>Arbitrageurs forcibly eliminate this fragmentation through cross-market operations: shorting tokens on exchanges while buying 'price won't exceed $4' outcome contracts in prediction markets. As long as the final opening price aligns with pre-market trends, this combination locks in profit. The result isn't just arbitrage itself; more importantly, prediction market probabilities are compressed, gradually aligning with real market expectations.</p><p>In summary, without centralized reviewers, benign arbitrage behavior also participates in building stable mechanisms maintaining mathematical and logical consistency in prediction markets.</p><h2>Where is the Boundary Between Benign and Malicious Arbitrage</h2><p>Regarding this question, as stated at the article's beginning, I believe it's difficult to have a clear 'boundary' distinguishing the two—in fact, none currently exists. But there are some 'gray areas' between them. Benign arbitrage should make markets healthier in results, providing corrections in price and probability, making outstanding contributions to market effectiveness; while malicious arbitrage's damage to users exceeds its contribution to markets.</p><p>We cannot completely distinguish benign from malicious at the code level, but we can gradually improve the boundary between them through continuous improvements in protocol design, market mechanisms, verifiable constraints, and exit rights.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Whether centralized or decentralized, markets have never been naturally 'smart'. Efficient market hypothesis believes asset prices always reflect all available information, and 'errors' cannot survive long-term. Arbitrageurs exist to solve market errors—this is cause and effect. But simultaneously, only when arbitrageurs' 'greed' is guided by reasonable mechanisms can they become the most reliable stabilizer in the decentralized world.</p><h2>Outlook</h2><p>Perhaps in the future, we won't need to 'bribe' wild arbitrageurs to maintain market stability. As encrypted mempools, intent networks, and OEV capture mechanisms mature, this arbitrage force originally existing in confrontational form will gradually be internalized and 'domesticated' by protocols. However, regardless of implementation path evolution, the core logic of 'completing error correction through games' won't change. This is precisely where the decentralized world differs from traditional financial systems in error correction mechanisms.</p><div class='article-footer mt-8 pt-6 border-t border-foreground/10'><p class='text-sm text-muted-foreground'>2026.01.04.06:23 Yang Zhuo Beijing Baiyan Building F12</p><p class='text-xs text-muted-foreground mt-2'><a href='https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/C4h5WVBOF0Jgvo8rdS_KUA' target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' class='hover:text-foreground transition-colors'>Read Original</a></p></div>",

        "content": "<h2>1. Overview: Understanding the OTC and AML Crossroads</h2><p>In this article, cryptocurrency OTC (Over-The-Counter) trading refers to asset transactions where parties do not use centralized exchange order books but conduct direct deals through private negotiation or intermediary facilitation. This model is commonly used for large transactions to avoid market slippage and provide liquidity for non-standard or illiquid tokens.</p><p>Anti-Money Laundering (AML) refers to a series of laws, regulations, and procedures aimed at preventing and curbing the legitimization of illegal proceeds through financial systems. For the Web3 industry, AML is the legal foundation for building industry trust, attracting institutional capital, and achieving large-scale adoption.</p><p>Global regulatory frameworks are tightening. The Financial Action Task Force (FATF)'s 'Travel Rule' requires Virtual Asset Service Providers (VASPs) to share transaction party information. Therefore, compliance has become the inevitable destination for OTC trading.</p><p>Proactively embracing AML compliance is the core strategy for OTC service providers to build long-term competitiveness. This helps them avoid legal risks and win trust from institutional clients and high-net-worth individuals.</p><h2>2. Global Regulatory Wave: External Drivers of OTC Compliance</h2><p>FATF extended the 'Travel Rule' to VASPs in 2019. This rule requires VASPs to collect and transmit identity information of transaction originators and beneficiaries when amounts exceed specific thresholds.</p><p>Major jurisdictions have different regulatory practices:</p><ul><li><strong>United States:</strong> FinCEN defines crypto OTC providers as Money Service Businesses (MSBs), requiring registration and strict Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) compliance.</li><li><strong>European Union:</strong> Markets in Crypto-Assets (MiCA) regulation establishes unified licensing and operational frameworks for VASPs across the EU.</li><li><strong>Hong Kong & Singapore:</strong> Both implement VASP licensing systems requiring capital, governance, and compliance standards to balance innovation and risk.</li></ul><p>Tightening regulations directly impact OTC markets. Unlicensed operation space is rapidly shrinking, and compliance costs are significantly rising. Customer Due Diligence (CDD) and transaction monitoring have shifted from best practices to legal requirements.</p><h2>3. Typical Money Laundering Risks in OTC Trading</h2><p>Blockchain addresses have pseudonymity - transaction records are public, but real identities behind addresses are typically unknown. Criminals exploit this to convert illegal funds to fiat through OTC. For example, Chainalysis reported that over $7 billion in illegal cryptocurrency was laundered through OTC brokers in 2022.</p><p>Three main money laundering risks in OTC trading:</p><ul><li><strong>Risk 1: Anonymity and Pseudonymity.</strong> Criminals use mixers or cross-chain bridges to quickly obfuscate fund sources, making it difficult for OTC platforms to trace original sources.</li><li><strong>Risk 2: Uncontrollable Counterparties.</strong> In peer-to-peer models, platforms struggle to conduct deep background checks on final counterparties, making OTC easy channels for illegal fund entry/exit.</li><li><strong>Risk 3: Direct Association with Illegal Activities.</strong> Proceeds from darknet markets, ransomware, or scams often quickly cash out through OTC counters, completing the final money laundering stage.</li></ul><h2>4. Building Compliant OTC Business: Core Framework and Tools</h2><p>Customer Due Diligence (CDD) is the basic process for VASPs to collect and verify customer identity information for risk assessment. This is the first line of AML defense.</p><p>CDD's core is Know Your Customer (KYC). An effective KYC process includes:</p><ul><li>Collecting customer identity documents (passports, driver's licenses)</li><li>Verifying document authenticity through third-party data sources or biometric technology</li><li>Confirming residential addresses and beneficial owner information</li><li>Assessing customer occupation, fund sources, and transaction purposes</li></ul><p>For high-risk customers, Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD) must be executed. High-risk customers include Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), users from high-risk jurisdictions, and those conducting unusually large transactions.</p><p>Transaction monitoring is the second pillar of compliance frameworks. It uses automated tools to continuously scan transaction activities to identify suspicious patterns, including:</p><ul><li>Interactions with known high-risk addresses (sanctioned addresses, darknet market addresses)</li><li>Large numbers of small transactions in short periods (structuring)</li><li>Rapid fund fragmentation and consolidation across multiple addresses without clear business purpose</li></ul><p>On-chain analytics tools track and analyze public blockchain transaction data. Tools like Chainalysis Reactor or Elliptic Navigator associate raw on-chain data with risk label databases, helping compliance teams visualize fund flows.</p><h2>5. Conclusion: Embracing Compliance, Building Web3 Finance Trust Foundation</h2><p>The core logic driving OTC compliance is clear and irreversible. Global regulatory frameworks, especially FATF's Travel Rule, constitute powerful external pressure. Meanwhile, OTC trading's inherent risks like pseudonymity and uncontrollable counterparties make it a potential money laundering channel. Therefore, building compliance frameworks including CDD, transaction monitoring, and sanctions screening has shifted from optional to essential for survival and development.</p><p>Compliance has profound structural impacts on the OTC industry. Its main value manifests in three aspects:</p><ul><li><strong>Gaining Trust and Legitimacy:</strong> Compliance is the ticket to attracting institutional capital. For example, OTC platforms holding US MSB licenses or Hong Kong VASP licenses can more smoothly access traditional banking systems and serve hedge funds and family offices.</li><li><strong>Building Long-term Business Moats:</strong> As regulations tighten, unlicensed or non-compliant operators will be eliminated. Service providers investing early in compliance will establish competitive barriers based on licenses, technology, and reputation.</li><li><strong>Promoting Overall Industry Health:</strong> Effective AML practices significantly compress illegal fund cash-out space. According to Chainalysis 2023 report, cryptocurrency flowing to illegal addresses declined for the second consecutive year, directly related to global VASP compliance strengthening.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, OTC trading's destination is compliance, revealing Web3 finance's essential path from periphery to mainstream. AML compliance is not a betrayal of decentralization spirit but the foundation for building a trustworthy, sustainable financial system that seamlessly interacts with the traditional world.</p>",
