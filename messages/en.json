Smart Contract Vulnerabilities</h3><p>Smart contract vulnerabilities remain the primary attack vector. Common vulnerabilities include:</p><ul><li>Reentrancy attacks</li><li>Integer overflow/underflow</li><li>Access control flaws</li><li>Logic errors</li></ul><h3>2. Cross-Chain Bridge Attacks</h3><p>Cross-chain bridges have become prime targets for hackers as they lock significant assets. Attack methods include bypassing validation mechanisms and signature forgery.</p><h3>3. Social Engineering Attacks</h3><p>Phishing websites, fake project teams, Discord/Telegram scams are becoming increasingly sophisticated.</p><h2>Defense Strategies</h2><h3>Code Audits</h3><p>Professional smart contract audits are essential before mainnet deployment. Choose qualified third-party audit firms.</p><h3>Multi-Signature</h3><p>Implement multi-signature mechanisms for critical operations to avoid single points of failure.</p><h3>Real-time Monitoring</h3><p>Deploy on-chain monitoring systems to detect anomalous transactions and potential attacks promptly.</p><h2>Conclusion</h2><p>Web3 security is a continuously evolving field.

Even audited contracts may have undiscovered issues.</p><h3>2. Liquidity Risk</h3><p>During market volatility, you may be unable to exit positions timely or suffer significant slippage losses.</p><h3>3. Oracle Risk</h3><p>DeFi protocols rely on oracles for price data; oracle manipulation can cause protocol anomalies.</p><h3>4. Governance Risk</h3><p>Malicious proposals or governance attacks may change protocol rules, harming user interests.</p><h2>Risk Management Strategies</h2><h3>Diversification</h3><p>Don't put all funds in a single protocol; diversify across multiple verified projects.</p><h3>Choose Audited Protocols</h3><p>Prioritize protocols audited by multiple reputable firms.</p><h3>Use Insurance Products</h3><p>Consider purchasing DeFi insurance like Nexus Mutual, InsurAce, etc.</p><h3>Set Stop-Loss</h3><p>Implement automatic stop-loss mechanisms for high-risk positions.</p><h3>Continuous Monitoring</h3><p>Regularly check protocol TVL, audit reports, and community feedback.</p><h2>Recommended Tools</h2><ul><li><strong>DeFi Pulse</strong>: Track DeFi protocol data</li><li><strong>DeFi Safety</strong>: Protocol security ratings</li><li><strong>Zapper / Zerion</strong>: Asset management dashboards</li></ul>"
